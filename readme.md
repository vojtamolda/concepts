Proofs of concept, demos and other random junk. You can safely ignore this repository and move on with your life.

I'd make this repository private (_Equivalent of putting the trash in the back alley bin._) but I'm too cheap to pay for a
GitHub plan (_So I just throw it in front of the house like on Manhattan_ ;)
